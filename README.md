# PantryQuest

PantryQuest is a React web app designed to help you discover recipes using ingredients you already have. Simply enter ingredients (separated by commas) to find matching recipes, or use predefined buttons to quickly browse popular cuisine and meal types.

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Search:** Enter multiple ingredients separated by commas (e.g., "tomato, chicken, basil") to find recipes that use those items.
- **Quick Search by Cuisine:** Use the predefined buttons for one-click access to recipes by cuisine or category. Options include:

  - African
  - Italian
  - Snack

- **Responsive Design:** PantryQuest is fully responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
